Posted on Dec 31, 2023 by Arnold Chand </div> <p>This year has not been the most productive as I’ve been. But slowly toward the end of the year I’ve been trying to work
on my projects as much as I could.</p>
<p>While that has been great, I want to expand more for the next year. I want to be able to focus more on my OSS projects,
create new projects that can get me excited or even contribute on project that I find exciting. Although, it’s quite
hard to find these project for my use-cases I’m still determined to be able to focus on them if I do find them. Bottom
line, find a project I can create or contribute on for a majority of the year.</p>
<p>The next thing I would like to do next year is travel. This year I only got to travel to one country, and while it was
a good visit, it was more so related to work than it was related for just leisure. So next year, 2024, I would like to
travel just for the sake of enjoying my free time.</p>
<p>As I’m out travelling, I would also want to look for opportunities to work outside my country. Currently, I
am freelancing with a client that has really helped me kick-start my career and I’m thankful for that! But I want to
experience what it feels like to have a full-time employment just for a year or two. However, I don’t want to do that
here in Trinidad, but if the opportunity arises before my travels then I might think about it.</p>
<p>So <em>big</em> plans ahead, and while I’m not sure if I would be able to do all that, I think having this post will really
help me remind myself on what I want to do or what else I might’ve missed that I could’ve added to the post. Well, only
time will tell how it would go. And I’m hoping that my consistency on writing a blog would also be part of those 2024
plans.</p> </div> </div> <div class="frontpage-divider"></div> <div class="app-footer flex justify-center items-center px-4"> <span>
