# About, Arnold Chand

I am a recent graduate of Western Michigan University completing my Masters in Electrical Engineering. My interest includes working with embedded systems, hardware and IoT. As much as I have an abundance of interests and passions in this industry, I have the best track record in terms of lacking experience.

My motivation on creating this blog is to document and keep a record of things I enjoy doing and add to my experience. This inculdes guides that I find lacking or just difficult to find online, insights on upcoming technologies or just thoughts on current trends, and just general portfolio projects to showcase.
